## **1. Introduction**

**The goal** is to develop a **chat messaging web application**. The application is intended to be **publicly deployed**, allowing users to sign up and use it for **end-to-end (E2E) encrypted messaging and video/audio calls** as a **casual
chat application**.

### **1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to define the **technical and functional specifications** for the chat messaging web application. It serves as a **guideline for developers** to ensure proper implementation, scalability, and security with
a planned roadmap.

This document aims to:

- Define the **core functionalities** (messaging, video/audio calls, authentication).
- Provide a **detailed system architecture** with microservices, APIs, and database structures.
- Outline **security measures**, including **end-to-end encryption** for private communication.
- Specify the **non-functional requirements** such as performance, availability, and scalability.
- Detail the **deployment strategy** for **cloud hosting** and **CI/CD automation**.

### **1.2 Scope**

The chat application will provide the following core functionalities:

#### **User Authentication & Authorization**

- JWT-based authentication with **Google OAuth2 integration**.
- Secure account creation and login with **email verification**.

#### **Real-time Messaging**

- One-to-one and group chats with **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)**.
- Message persistence using **PostgreSQL (users) & MongoDB (messages)**.

#### **Voice & Video Calls**

- **WebRTC-based** peer-to-peer (P2P) and server-relayed calls.
- **Multi-user conference support**.

#### **Multimedia Sharing**

- Users can send **images, videos, and files** in chats.
- **Cloud-based media storage integration**.

#### **Notification System**

- **Push notifications** for new messages and call invites.
- **Email notifications** for user engagement.

---

## **2. System Overview**

### **2.1 System Context**

The chat application is a **publicly deployed, real-time messaging platform** that allows users to **communicate securely** using **E2E-encrypted messaging, voice, and video calls**. It operates in a **microservices architecture**, with independent services handling authentication, messaging, media storage, and notifications.

### 2.2 **High-Level Architecture**

As for decoupling responsibilities and making it scalable, chosen architecture style is **Microservices**. We have Primary mediator of Spring Cloud API Gateway, delegating requests to microservices connected via Eureka Service registration.

    subgraph "Cache"
        J[(Redis)]
    end

    subgraph "External-Services"
        K[AWS S3]
    end
```


The system consists of:

- **React.js Frontend** ‚Äì Provides the user interface for chat, calls, and notifications.
- **Spring Boot Backend** ‚Äì Manages authentication, chat processing, and notification handling.
- **Databases:**
  - **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Stores user accounts and relationships.
  - **MongoDB** ‚Äì Stores chat history and saved notifications.
- **RabbitMQ** ‚Äì Handles asynchronous messaging for **emails & notifications.
- **Redis** ‚Äì Caches frequently accessed and **‚Äúhot data‚Äù** to improve performance.

### **2.3 Core Components & Their Roles**

#### **Frontend: React.js App**
- Provides a responsive **UI** for using whole application.
- Communicates with the backend using **REST APIs** and **WebSockets** for real-time updates.

#### **Auth Service**
- Manages **JWT-based authentication** and **Google OAuth2 login**.
- Handles **user account management**, including **CRUD operations for user entities**.
- Interacts with **PostgreSQL** for storing user profiles and authentication data.

#### **Chat Service**
- Handles **real-time messaging, group chats, and chat management**.
- Directly interacts with **MongoDB** to store **chat messages and conversation history**.
- Supports **message encryption** for end-to-end security.

#### **Notification Service**
- Consumes messages from **RabbitMQ queues** to handle:
  - **Push notifications** for new messages and events via **WebSockets**.
  - **Email notifications** via **Google SMTP** for account-related actions.

#### **Call Service**
- Microservice responsible for **WebRTC-based audio/video calls** with **screen sharing**.
- Manages **peer-to-peer signaling** and **TURN/STUN server integration**.
- Ensures **secure and encrypted** communication using **DTLS-SRTP**.

#### **Databases**
- **PostgreSQL**
  - Contains two schemas:
    1. **Auth Service Schema** ‚Äì Stores user authentication & profile data.
    2. **Chat Service Schema** ‚Äì Manages **relational chat data** (friendships, requests, blocks).
  
- **MongoDB**
  - Stores two major collections:
    1. **Chat Service Collections** ‚Äì Persists chat messages and conversation metadata.
    2. **Notification Service Collections** ‚Äì Saves push/email notification logs.

#### **Cache: Redis**
- Caches **frequently accessed profile data** to reduce database queries.
- Stores **user online status** and **active session information** for real-time updates.

#### **Messaging: RabbitMQ**
- Manages **asynchronous messaging** with two queues:
  - **Email Queue** ‚Äì Processes and sends user emails.
  - **Push Notification Queue** ‚Äì Handles mobile and web push notifications.
#### **AWS S3**
- Cloud-based **file storage system** for:
  - **Chat attachments** (images, videos, files).
  - **Profile pictures** and other **user-uploaded media**
